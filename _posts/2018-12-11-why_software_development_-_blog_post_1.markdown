Over time, I have tried a few different industries to accel at and immerse in: writing, nursing, politics, massage therapy, etc.  When none of those were panning out for a variety of life reasons, I wondered what is next then?  I will keep taking classes in something, but ultimately, what do I want to do in terms of a professional career?

After one more setback trying to afford a college way too expensive for my income and circumstances, I returned back to my community college to keep taking general classes needed toward any science degree, as in higher level math, science and any missing prerequisites.  I thought, any of these classes could work toward a higher level degree toward a biology, physics or some engineering based degree, I'll take them and see what I get inspired toward.

I really enjoyed my higher level math courses, I had always thought of myself as being a little mediocore at math unless I had some phenomenal teacher which rarely exists.  I decided I could definitely handle the rest of the math requried for any major and continued on into Calculus I, which also went very well, it was like a math puzzle.

In between semesters and busy times within classes, I decided to start a blog site on WordPress to post a couple essays I enjoyed writing, thinking it may also, additionally, inspire me to continue writing creatively as an outlet beyond academics.  Sadly, I still only have two posts, more to come perhaps in the future.  However, what I experienced on the WordPress platform inspired me to take my first computer science class.

Logging on and setting up an initial WordPress blog, is, sure, great.  However, after choosing a predetermeined template that looked good enough, I suppose, I wanted to change things, add things in different places, have certain images and other layouts appear in a certain way, modify the borders, background images, decide whether or not I even wanted an image header displayed across the top, etc.  I noticed, because WordPress operates on someone else's templates they made in their own HTML, CSS and WordPress's overall driving code, I couldn't change everything the way I wanted to, have things aligned as I envisioned and needless to say I couldn't remove the really ugly, terribly tacky ads that pop up on my blog's pages unless I wanted to pay WordPress extra money.

Excuse me, WordPress?! Last time I checked if I want a website with a certain name, appearance and no ads at all I pay a really small fee and make the thing myself if I really want, minimially, I can just add to the body of a static page and make it appear as if it is an operational blog.  Not only this, but I can change every little thing in appearance and layout and not be limited to some other user's interpretation of functionality.

So, I started dabbling in HTML and CSS and decided my next class at the community college needed to be Introduction to Computer science.  I had so much fun in that class working through the different problems.  I noticed I got lost in time on my problems that were more difficult to solve, trying different ways to make the console applications run as intended, I would forget to eat at times.  Maybe that's not good, but I never had any other task occupy my mind so much, it was amazing to have such an innate and intense focus.  On the occasion I couldn't solve a problem immediately, I'd walk away from it, go do something else, but my mind was already back on the problem somehow, refreshed and ready to tackle the coding problem from some new angle I hadn't thought of previously.

I thought this is amazing, I love this stuff, I would love to sit around (or stand for standing desks, I have to get one of those too maybe with a treadmill, not sure) and do nothing but solve these intricate problems all based on this complex network of keywords and functions that end up generating more amazing things such as video games, advanced electronics, cars, planes, medical equipment and anything else that could exist in the future, not on the market yet.  It is a massive and infinite industry with so many avenues.

Ready to move out of New York City and back to warm weather I applied at Florida International University for Computer Science and got accepted.  That is all fun and well, but I decided to accelerate the learning and career process by applying to the Flatiron school, here, representative of this blog post, I think because technology changes so quickly it is best just to get immeresed into the career path as soon as possible and start gaining experience.
